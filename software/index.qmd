With the advent of generative models, the field of unsupervised learning has
exploded in the last decade. One of the most popular generative models is the
variational autoencoder (VAE). VAEs assume the existence of a joint probability
distribution between a high-dimensional data space and a lower-dimensional
latent space. The VAE parametrizes this joint distribution with two neural
networks–an encoder and a decoder–using a variational inference approach. This
approach allows for the model to approximate the underlying low-dimensional
structure that generated the observed data and generate new data samples by
sampling from the learned latent space. Several variations of the original VAE
have been proposed to extend its capabilities and tackle different problems.
Here, we present `AutoEncoderToolkit.jl`, a `Julia` package for training VAEs and
its extensions. The package is built on top of the
[Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) deep learning library and provides
a simple and flexible interface for training different flavors of VAEs.
Furthermore, the package provides a set of utilities for the geometric analysis
of the learned latent space.

With modern barcoding and sequencing technologies, high-throughput pooled assays
have become a popular experimental platform in experimental evolution. In these
experiments, a population of uniquely barcoded cellular lineages is grown over
multiple growth-dilution cycles. This produces large amounts of barcode count
data to infer the relative fitness of each lineage. `BarBay.jl` is a `Julia`
software package specially designed for the analysis of such data. Based on
variational Bayesian inference, it provides a flexible and efficient framework
for the estimation of fitness parameters with principled uncertainty
quantification.
