    "text": "SCRIBE (work in progress)\n\n github repository   |  documentation  \nSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our ability to study cellular heterogeneity, but analyzing this data comes with unique statistical challenges. SCRIBE (Single-Cell RNA-Seq Inference using Bayesian Estimation) is a Python package that addresses these challenges through a novel approach using variational inference based on Numpyro—a JAX-based probabilistic programming library. What sets SCRIBE apart is its comprehensive suite of probabilistic models specifically designed for scRNA-seq count data, including the innovative Negative Binomial-Dirichlet Multinomial (NBDM) model that simultaneously accounts for both count magnitudes and proportions. The package offers multiple model variants to handle common technical artifacts in scRNA-seq data, such as zero-inflation and variable capture efficiency, while providing GPU acceleration for efficient analysis of large-scale datasets. SCRIBE seamlessly integrates with the AnnData ecosystem and includes visualization tools for posterior analysis, making it a powerful solution for researchers working with single-cell transcriptomics data.\n\n\nAutoEncoderToolkit.jl\n\n open-access PDF   |  github repository   |  documentation  \nWith the advent of generative models, the field of unsupervised learning has exploded in the last decade. One of the most popular generative models is the variational autoencoder (VAE). VAEs assume the existence of a joint probability distribution between a high-dimensional data space and a lower-dimensional latent space. The VAE parametrizes this joint distribution with two neural networks–an encoder and a decoder–using a variational inference approach. This approach allows for the model to approximate the underlying low-dimensional structure that generated the observed data and generate new data samples by sampling from the learned latent space. Several variations of the original VAE have been proposed to extend its capabilities and tackle different problems. Here, we present AutoEncoderToolkit.jl, a Julia package for training VAEs and its extensions. The package is built on top of the Flux.jl deep learning library and provides a simple and flexible interface for training different flavors of VAEs. Furthermore, the package provides a set of utilities for the geometric analysis of the learned latent space.\n\n\nBarBay.jl\n\n open-access PDF   |  paper website   |  documentation  \nWith modern barcoding and sequencing technologies, high-throughput pooled assays have become a popular experimental platform in experimental evolution. In these experiments, a population of uniquely barcoded cellular lineages is grown over multiple growth-dilution cycles. This produces large amounts of barcode count data to infer the relative fitness of each lineage. BarBay.jl is a Julia software package specially designed for the analysis of such data. Based on variational Bayesian inference, it provides a flexible and efficient framework for the estimation of fitness parameters with principled uncertainty quantification."

    "text": "(2018) Quantitative modeling of gene regulation via allosteric proteins\n\n open-access PDF   |  paper website   |  github repository  \nDespite lacking a nervous system, single bacterial cells can make decisions given signals from their surroundings. How can individual molecules sense and transmit these signals? The answer comes from one of the crowning scientific achievements of the past century: allostery. Simply stated, allostery is the property of certain macromolecules to exist in multiple conformations with different properties. For example, transcription factors —proteins that control gene expression— can be active (able to bind the DNA) or inactive (unable to bind DNA) depending on the concentration of a signaling molecule.\nIn a 2018 paper, our socialist team wrote down a theoretical model that predicts the expression level of a gene regulated by an allosteric transcription factor. We then tested the model experimentally, showing that the model was able to predict how changes to the regulation of the gene translates to changes in the cellular response."

My research focuses on developing novel computational approaches that combine dynamical systems theory, biophysical modeling, and deep learning techniques to extract actionable insights from complex multi-scale biological datasets.\nI am particularly passionate about Evolution and the Physics of Living Systems, believing that understanding evolution requires physics-like approaches, especially techniques borrowed from statistical physics and complex systems. My work aims to create robust, scalable workflows that bridge fundamental cellular principles with rigorous data-driven decision making—all implemented with strong software engineering practices to ensure reproducibility and deployment readiness.\nI completed my Ph.D. with Rob Phillips at Caltech, where I explored how cells gather information from the environment, process it, and build responses to maintain homeostasis.
