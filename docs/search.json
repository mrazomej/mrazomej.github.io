In these experiments, a population of uniquely barcoded cellular lineages is grown over multiple growth-dilution cycles. This produces large amounts of barcode count data to infer the relative fitness of each lineage. BarBay.jl is a Julia software package specially designed for the analysis of such data. Based on variational Bayesian inference, it provides a flexible and efficient framework for the estimation of fitness parameters with principled uncertainty quantification."

    "text": "(2018) Quantitative modeling of gene regulation via allosteric proteins\n\n open-access PDF   |  paper website   |  github repository  \nDespite lacking a nervous system, single bacterial cells can make decisions given signals from their surroundings. How can individual molecules sense and transmit these signals? The answer comes from one of the crowning scientific achievements of the past century: allostery. Simply stated, allostery is the property of certain macromolecules to exist in multiple conformations with different properties. For example, transcription factors —proteins that control gene expression— can be active (able to bind the DNA) or inactive (unable to bind DNA) depending on the concentration of a signaling molecule.\nIn a 2018 paper, our socialist team wrote down a theoretical model that predicts the expression level of a gene regulated by an allosteric transcription factor. We then tested the model experimentally, showing that the model was able to predict how changes to the regulation of the gene translates to changes in the cellular response."

I also closely collaborate with Madhav Mani at Northwestern University. My two biggest scientific passions are Evolution and the Physics of Living Systems. Although these two topics might seem very different, I believe that understanding evolution requires physics-like approaches, especially techniques borrowed from statistical physics and complex systems.\nI did my Ph.D. with Rob Phillips at Caltech, working at the interface between physics and biology, where I explored how cells can gather information from the environment, process it, and build a response to keep them alive.\nOutside of my research, I really like reading popular science books, and I’m starting a collection of science-based essays about different topics (more on that soon!). In addition, I love hip-hop, backpacking, and a good Mezcal."
