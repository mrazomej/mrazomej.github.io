I am a graduate student at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) working with [Rob
Phillips](http://rpgroup.caltech.edu/). I was born and rasied in [Leon,
Guanajuato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le%C3%B3n,_Guanajuato) where I lived
all of my life until moving to Pasadena, CA.

I am fascinated by how can we understand biological systems using physical
principles. I believe [physics is not a
discipline](https://nautil.us/issue/35/boundaries/why-physics-is-not-a-discipline)
but a completely different way to interpret nature that can give us new insights
into the vital quesiton of *What is Life?* My particular professional interests
revolve around how do organisms evolve, and how can we predict such evolutionary
trajectories. I am also deeply interested in questions having to do with origins
of life. Some of my favorite science books related to these questions are

- [Improbable Destinies: Fate, Chance, and the Future of
  Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/Improbable-Destinies-Chance-Future-Evolution-ebook/dp/B01N7F3XE3/ref=sr_1_1?crid=32RYUIWONF84L&dchild=1&keywords=improbable+destinies+fate%2C+chance%2C+and+the+future+of+evolution&qid=1605817589&sprefix=improbable+des%2Caps%2C216&sr=8-1).

  Life](https://www.amazon.com/Vital-Question-Evolution-Origins-Complex/dp/0393352978/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2U5XM2GQF33YR&dchild=1&keywords=the+vital+question&qid=1605817492&sprefix=the+vital+qu%2Caps%2C220&sr=8-1).

Outside of science I love exploring nature. I am really into camping and hiking!
The pictures you can see on every tab in this website were taken in some of the
journeys I've been lucky enough to enjoy during my PhD. I also love eating, and
would define myself as a 2-3Ïƒ in terms of how much I love spicy food (even for
Mexican standards!). My favorite liquor is definitely
[Mezcal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezcal). I also like playing chess and
some videogames --in particular Super Smash Bros. So hit me up if you want to
play.
