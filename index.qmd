# About me

I am a [2021 Schmidt Science
Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/fellow/manuel-razo-mejia/) working in
the lab of [Dmitri Petrov](https://petrov.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford
University](http://stanford.edu). I also closely collaborate with [Madhav
Mani](https://www.madhavmani.com) at Northwestern University. My two biggest
scientific passions are Evolution and the Physics of Living Systems. Although
these two topics might seem very different, I believe that understanding
evolution requires physics-like approaches, especially techniques borrowed from
statistical physics and complex systems.

I did my [Ph.D.](https://mrazomej.github.io/phd) with [Rob
Phillips](http://rpgroup.caltech.edu/) at [Caltech](http://caltech.edu), working
at the interface between physics and biology, where I explored how cells can
gather information from the environment, process it, and build a response to
keep them alive. If you are interested, you can check [my
thesis](https://mrazomej.github.io/phd/).
