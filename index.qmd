# About me

I am a computational scientist specializing in machine learning and statistical
inference for biological data analysis, currently working in the lab of [Dmitri
Petrov](https://petrov.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford
University](http://stanford.edu) and collaborating with [Madhav
Mani](https://www.madhavmani.com) at Northwestern University. My research
focuses on developing novel computational approaches that combine dynamical
systems theory, biophysical modeling, and deep learning techniques to extract
actionable insights from complex multi-scale biological datasets.

I am particularly passionate about Evolution and the Physics of Living Systems,
believing that understanding evolution requires physics-like approaches,
especially techniques borrowed from statistical physics and complex systems. My
work aims to create robust, scalable workflows that bridge fundamental cellular
principles with rigorous data-driven decision makingâ€”all implemented with strong
software engineering practices to ensure reproducibility and deployment
readiness.

I completed my [Ph.D.](https://mrazomej.github.io/phd) with [Rob
Phillips](http://rpgroup.caltech.edu/) at [Caltech](http://caltech.edu), where I
explored how cells gather information from the environment, process it, and
build responses to maintain homeostasis. You can learn more about this work in
[my thesis](https://mrazomej.github.io/phd/).
